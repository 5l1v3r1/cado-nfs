Here are some short term objectives (as of November 2007):

  - Fallback strategies for all factorization functions (find more relations,
    change multiplier, etc.) to make them more robust. This is currently done
    for CFRAC and SQUFOF only and needs to be extended to QS and SIQS.

  - Improve QS and SIQS implementations (still below par performance-wise?).
    This is a work in progress, even if these implementations were vastly
    improved recently.
