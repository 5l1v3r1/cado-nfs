Block Wiedemann.  
For the impatient, there's a ./bw.pl script which illustrates how the
solver works. It works as follows, for checking random matrices.

./doit.pl msize=10000 dens=100 modulus=31 mn=8 vectoring=2 threshold=128

./doit.pl msize=10000 dens=100 modulus=2 mn=64 vectoring=64 multisols=1

or

./doit.pl matrix=/tmp/my_matrix.txt


The latter forms allows solving of an arbitrary matrix.

The solver looks for a ***COLUMN*** dependency, thus one first has to apply
the linalg/transpose program if row dependencies are sought.
For example for a c59 NFS run:

% set tmp=/localdisk/tmp
% ../transpose $tmp/c59.1.0x6x10x100.small $tmp/c59.1.0x6x10x100.small.tr
% ./doit.pl matrix=$tmp/c59.1.0x6x10x100.small.tr mn=64 vectoring=64 multisols=1 

The parameters mn and vectoring are documented below.

Two matrix formats are recognized.
Either the matrix file has to start with a magic comment like:
// 12345 ROWS 12345 COLUMNS MODULUS 41
or with a single header line:
12345 12345
(nrows, ncolumns), meaning that we're working over the binary field.

Then rows indicate the number of non-zero coeffs, plus the indices of the
zero coeffs (append :42 if the coeff equals 42 and not 1).


In order to obtain several column dependencies on a binary matrix /tmp/mat, one
would do:

./doit.pl matrix=/tmp/mat mn=64 vectoring=64 tidy=0 multisols=1

Some data on the options (defaults in brackets)


msize=, dens=	set the characteristics for an example matrix
modulus=	guess...
mn=, m=, n=	set the m and n parameters for block wiedemann (mn sets both)
vectoring=k	process k vectors y at a time. There must be code capable
		of handling this. For binary fields, 8, 16, 32, 64, and
                128 are accepted values.
method=		selection of the FFT method for the fast linear generator
		computation
dump=1		only relevant for small tests -- dump magma code for debugging.
		default: 0, do not dump.
dumpcfg=1	prints what should go in a test file. Useful for
		producing regression tests in tests/
		default: 0, do not print
multisols=1	produces all solutions instead of only one.
		default: 0, only one solution
threshold=xxx	threshold for the fast lingen algorithm (mandatory when
		relevant). 128 is a good hint.
resume=1	try to resume from an interrupted computation
		default: 0, do not try to resume
wdir=		working directory ($ENV{HOME}/Local/testmat by default)
seed=xxx	select random seed
precond=	input preconditioner (look forward to rhs= option, someday)
mt=n		select multithreaded code, using n threads
		default: 0, not multithreaded.
machines=	set of slave machines
rsync=1		push working dir to machines with rsync (alternatively,
		one can use an NFS shared dir)
		default: 0, assume an NFS shared dir is used.
tidy=0		do not remove the working directory once the computation
		is finished
		default: 1, do remove the directory.

Restarting from a checkpoint.
* in theory, it should suffice to restart the bw.pl command issued by say
  cadofactor.pl, with the added ``resume=1'' option on the command line.
  however this functionality has its ups and downs over time.
* as a workaround, for a restart in krylov:
  1) save a backup of the bw directory ; you may hard-link matrix file
     from the backup directory to the original
  2) start bw.pl
  3) once the krylov command line is issued in the stderr file, kill
     bw.pl, copy back the contents of the backup directory to where they
     were originally, and later on copy-paste the krylov command.
