[x] Get rid of factor.sh

  - the toplevel script is now cado-nfs.py (cadofactor.py has moved). It 
    takes care of finding parameter files, creating a working
    directory, and so on.
  - cado-nfs.py and cado-nfs-client.py are still copied to the build
    tree, but not with the purpose of allowing to run the scripts from
    there.
  - by default, the binaries whose location is given by "make show" are
    chosen.
  - this is supposed to work also after make install, including with
    shared libraries set up (provided by give a slaves.bindir option)

[X] Have correctly tuned parameter files
  - only up to 155 digits, by step of 5, starting from 60
  - want a larger size? see customer service!

  - ship parameter file for p155 + hintfile
  - review documentation

[x] Fix memory issue in las

[x] Delete dead code
  - still a lot, but for later.

[x] Check the list of bugs and feature requests

[x] Update the timings on the web page and check we have no regression
