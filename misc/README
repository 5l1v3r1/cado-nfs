1) convert a polynomial from CADO format to Franke-Kleinjung format:

% $CADO/misc/convert_poly -if cado -of fk < rsa100.poly > rsa100

2) convert relations from CADO format to Franke-Kleinjung format
(warning you have to specify the degree of the algebraic polynomial):

% $CADO/misc/convert_rels -if cado -of fk -deg 5 rsa100.rels > part1

3) use msieve linear algebra with relations in CADO format:

   a) create a file msieve.fb, which contains:

      N <number to be factored>
      R0  <coeff of x^0, rational side>
      R1  <coeff of x^1, rational side>
      A0  <coeff of x^0, algebraic side>
      A1  <etc>
      A2  <etc>
      A3  <etc>
      A4  <etc>
      A5  <etc>

      This can be done with:

      $ ./convert_poly -of msieve < cxxx.poly > msieve.fb

   b) create a file msieve.dat, which contains:

      N <number to be factored>
      <all the relations in GGNFS/CADO format>

      (Do not include free relations, since the CADO-NFS format is not
       recognized by msieve, and msieve includes them in the filtering.)

   c) then run "msieve -nc -v <number to be factored>"
      The msieve output goes into msieve.log.
      You can add the "-t 4" option to use 4 threads.
