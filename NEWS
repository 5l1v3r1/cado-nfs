Important changes between cado-nfs-1.0 and cado-nfs-1.1:

* the polynomial selection uses the new algorithm presented by Kleinjung at
  the 2008 CADO workshop (supports multithreading)
* connecting rootsieve5 in the polynomial selection
* las supports I=16 (useful for the integer greater than 200 digits), minor bug
  fix, small speedup in las and purge.
* reorganization executable in the linear algebra step and acceleration
  of computing time on many machines with mpi.
* addition of experimental scripts to execute the sieve on a cluster.
  These scrips rely on the OAR job scheduler being used, and exploit its 
  "besteffort" mode. Some even more exeprimental scripts for linear
  algebra are in the development version.
* addition of new parameter files and few new variables inside (cf
  params.c91)
* The linear algebra step now makes some use of dynamically loaded shared
  libraries. This might result in configuration issues, which we hope the
  scripts get right. See the README file.
