Main changes between cado-nfs-1.1 and cado-nfs-1.2:

* the replay step is faster and uses less memory

Main changes between cado-nfs-1.0 and cado-nfs-1.1:

* the polynomial selection uses the new algorithm presented by Kleinjung at
  the 2008 CADO workshop (supports multithreading)
* the polynomial selection uses a faster root sieve (rootsieve5)
* the lattice siever (las) supports a larger sieving region (I=16). This is
  useful for integers greater than 200 digits
* minor bug fixes, small speedup in sieving (las) and filtering (purge)
* reorganization of the binaries in the linear algebra step and speedup
  when using many machines with MPI
* new experimental scripts to execute the sieve on a cluster.
  These scripts rely on the OAR job scheduler being used, and exploit its 
  "besteffort" mode. Some even more experimental scripts for linear
  algebra are in the development version.
* addition of new parameter files and a few new parameters (cf params.c91)
* the linear algebra step now makes use of dynamically loaded shared
  libraries. This might result in configuration issues, which we hope the
  scripts get it right. See the README file.
