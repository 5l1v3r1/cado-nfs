General:
========

* portability: we should check improve portability on Win64, where
  long has 32 bits (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb496995.aspx).
  See http://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-discuss/2008-June/003243.html and
  the 3 possible models (most C programs in CADO-NFS assume LP64):
  * LP64 defines "int" as 32 bits and "long" as 64 bits.
  * LLP64 defines "int" and "long" as 32 bits, and an additional type
    (usually called "long long") as 64 bits.
  * ILP64 defines "int" and "long" as 64 bits.

Polyselect:
===========

* use the other definition of the E-value, see formula (5.8) page 87 of
  Murphy's thesis. Currently CADO-NFS uses the definition on page 99,
  where Murphy says that the former definition is more reliable.

Sieve:
======

* An (a,b)-pair where the sieving leaves a value not exceeding the sieve
  report threshold on both the rational side and the algebraic side
  goes to the cofactorization phase. However, if on both sides the
  remaining sieve value is just a little below the respective threshold,
  then this (a,b)-pair has little chance of becoming a relation:
  since the lambda value is increased a little to account for rounding
  errors, one of the two cofactors may be too large, and even if they
  aren't, we know they're both pretty large so it's unlikely that both
  split completely into primes < lpb.
  We can add another threshold, a combined lambda
  clambda < alambda + rlambda
  and add the condition that the sum of remaining values after sieving
  must not exceed lpb^clambda.
  That should reduce the number of sieve survivors that don't become
  relations, thus reducing pressure on the cofactorization phase,
  without losing too many relations.

* [idea from Alexander Kruppa, October 2011] run a sieve test to determine,
  for each pair (s,t) of bit-sizes of cofactors on the algebraic and rational
  sides, the probability p(s,t) that we find a relation. Then we run again the
  siever with input that file and a probability threshold p0. If p(s,t) < p0,
  then we don't run the cofactorization.

Linear algebra:
===============

* write some conversions routines from the CADO-NFS format to the msieve format
  and vice versa. From Jason Papadopoulos: "The cycle file and matrix file
  formats Msieve uses are described in the Readme.nfs document in the Msieve
  source."
