How to set up MinGW for compiling CADO on a Windows Virtual machine

==== System-wide installation and settings ====

1. Set up a VM as described in howto-windows.txt

2. Disable popups for aborted programs in Widows Action Center (HOW?) or
they keep popping up during configuration test runs

3. Install MinGW:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/
"Looking for the latest version? Download x86-mingw32-build-1.0-sh.tar.bz2 (24.9 kB)"
Run it. Choose "Download latest repository catalogues." Choose C compiler, C++ compiler, MinGW Developer Toolkit
We assume C:\MinGW as the MinGW installation directory

4. Make directory "C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\mingw", used as mount point (will be added
to fstab by /postinstall/pi.sh)

5. Open MinGW shell

6. run /pi/postinstall.sh

8. Install GMP for MinGW with: (don't install msys-libgmp!)
mingw-get install mingw32-libgmp

9. Download and install CMake from 
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

10. Download and install Git from http://git-scm.com/downloads 
Tell Git to add its program directory to the System Path variable, 
or add it yourself, e.g., in 
Start/Computer/System Properties/Advanced Settings/Environment Variables/System Variables
change PATH and append (possibly replacing the directory name to the correct 
directory where Git is installed):
;C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\cmd

==== Per-user installation and settings ====

7. Make ssh key and copy to VM host computer, write .ssh/config entry

11. Clone CADO git

12. Create .gitattributes in working directory root with contents:
# .gitattributes start
* eol=lf
# .gitattributes end

Check that the attributes are properly taken into account with:

git check-attr -a gf2x/gf2x/gf2x-config.h.in

The output should be:

gf2x/gf2x/gf2x-config.h.in: eol: lf

13. Create .gitignore in working directory root with contents:
# .gitignore start
.gitignore
.gitattributes
local.sh
build/
*~
# .gitignore end

14. Convert line endings to LF with
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard

15. Convert link to copies of files. In working directory root, run:
scripts/winlinks.sh

16. Create local.sh which should include these lines:
### local.sh start
GMP=C:/MinGW
CMAKE_GENERATOR="MSYS Makefiles"
### local.sh end

17. run
make
