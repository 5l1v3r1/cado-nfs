This code is here only for reference and example. It computes an
arbitrary e-th root in a number field given the factorization in ideals
of contributing elements.

It's not working with the tools from cado-nfs at the moment.

It requires several files as for example in the medium38/ directory.

the main file is sol.m ;

load "sol.m" ; suffices to show the thing in actions. It prints a set of
(r+1) numbers in the end. If everything went well, the first of them
must equal some of the other ones.
