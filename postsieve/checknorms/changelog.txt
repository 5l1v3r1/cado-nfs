  - Tue May 13 2008 by JM:
      - Corrected severe grammar error in output messages (thanks Paul!).
        Will now go through http://www.better-english.com/grammar/toomuch.htm
        as a punishment...

  - Fri Jan 25 2008 by JM:
      - Renamed the previous checknorms.c version to checknorms.2lp.c ("2lp" 
        standing for "2 large primes")
      - Splitted checknorms in .c and .h parts.
      - Removed -factorall option.
      - checknorms now accepts residuals with as many large primes as wanted.
        Default is 4. Use -maxnlp option on the command line to override.
      - Added -cmult option (short for "count multiplicites") to consider p^m
        as m large prime. By default checknorms will handle it as a single 
        prime.
      - Added -h (help) option.
      - WARNING: This revamped checknorms is not fully tested yet. The
                 daredevils are welcomed to play with it but the faints of
                 heart should stick with the older one (checknorms.2lp.c is
                 also compiled).

  - Tue Jan  8 2008 by JM:
      - Added '-factorall' option changing behaviour of factorization of norms.
      - WARNING: revision 504 or higher of the TIFA library required to use
        to use the '-factorall' option.

  - Thu Dec 20 2007 by JM:
      - Initial version based on Paul Zimmermann's checknorms program.
