 TIFA library (Tools for Integer FActorization)
 ----------------------------------------------

 0.1: First internal release (circa June 2006).

 0.2: Second internal release (still in development).

      - switched from the autotools to SCons as the build system
      - refactoring of the factoring algorithms
      - refactoring of all of the Perl scripts
      - WARNING: timing files' format changed!
      - WARNING: some API's changed!
      - implementation of the basic Quadratic Sieve
      - implementation of the Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve
      - implementation of the Square Form Factorization algorithm (small
        numbers only though, less than double precision) with "fast return"
      - implementation of the Elliptic Curve Method (ECM)
      - implementation of McKee's speedup of Fermat's factorization algorithm
        (greedy variant) with multiplier race.
      - switched from MPZ to MPN layer of GMP for critical parts of code
      - misc bug fixes
