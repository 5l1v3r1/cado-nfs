More bugs and issues are likely to be found once the library will be more
widely distributed.

Main bugs and outstanding issues
--------------------------------

  - BETA VERSION WARNING:

        The library is still in active development and may^H^H^H certainly
        have rough edges. As a result, things may (or rather, will) crash, 
        and/or, fry your computer, burn your house, destroy the ozone layer 
        (or what's left of it) and, incidentally, give wrong results.

  - The QS and SIQS implementations need more optimizations and fine-tuning.
    Right now, they are somewhat sub par performance-wise even if they 
    dramatically improved recently.

  - Should the integer types used be changed? Some functions use standard
    long ints (signed or unsigned) while some use the C99 types int32_t,
    int64_t, etc. Time to unify all that?
  
  - WARNING:
  
        - Simple large prime variation is mandatory for the time being! Code
          refactoring is (yet again!) in process and the "no large prime"
          variation has not been "replugged" for the time being.
