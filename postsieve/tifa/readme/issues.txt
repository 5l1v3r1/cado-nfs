 TIFA: Bugs and outstanding issues
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     - INSTABLE VERSION WARNING:

           The library just went through a huge refactoring! As a result,
           things may (or rather, will) crash, and/or, fry your computer, burn
           your house, destroy the ozone layer (or what's left of it) and,
           incidentally, give wrong results.

     - The QS and SIQS implementations need to be optimized and fine-tuned.
       Right now, they _are_ definitely sub par performance-wise even if they
       somewhat improved recently.
