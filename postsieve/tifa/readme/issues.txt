Main bugs and outstanding issues
--------------------------------

  - BETA VERSION WARNING:

        The library is still in active development and may^H^H^H certainly
        have rough edges. As a result, things may (or rather, will) crash, 
        and/or, fry your computer, burn your house, destroy the ozone layer 
        (or what's left of it) and, incidentally, give wrong results.

  - The QS and SIQS implementations need to be optimized and fine-tuned.
    Right now, they _are_ definitely sub par performance-wise even if they
    somewhat improved recently.

  - Should the integer types used be changed? Some functions use standard
    long ints (signed or unsigned) while some use the C99 types int32_t,
    int64_t, etc. Time to unify all that?
