Here are some short term objectives (as of June 2007):

  - Fallback strategies for all factorization functions (find more relations,
    change multiplier, etc.) to make them more robust. This is currently done
    for CFRAC only and needs to be extended to QS and SIQS.

  - Implement a multi-step early abort strategy (as described by Carl Pomerance
    in "Analysis and Comparison of Some Integer Factoring Algorithms").

  - Tune QS and SIQS implementations (right now far below par performance-wise).
    This is still a work in progress, even if these implementations somewhat
    improved recently.
