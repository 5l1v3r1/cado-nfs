 TIFA v0.2.0:
 ------------

 - December 2007:
       - Misc. clean ups.
       - Added generic tifa_factor functions.

 - Late October / November 2007:
       - Several enhancements to QS / SIQS and some cleaning / refactoring.

 - Early October 2007:
       - Implemented multi-step early abort strategy.
       - Changed factor extraction for congruence of square methods.

 - September 2007:
       - Tuned McKee's Fermat variant. Now use a multiplier race.
       
 - Early September 2007:
       - Added modinv_ui function in funcs.c.
       - Added sqrtm_p2 function in funcs.c.

 - Late August 2007:
       - Added untuned implementation of McKee's speedup of Fermat's
         algorithm (more precisely the "greedy" variant). This implementation
         is, for the time being, not competitive at all with respect to
         SQUFOF or even QS.
       
 - Late July/early August 2007:
       - SQUFOF now uses the "fast return" trick to speed-up the last part
         of the algorithm.

 - Early July 2007:
       - Minor optimizations of the quadratic residues generation for CFRAC.
       
 - June 2007:
       - Misc fixes.
       - Added clone_binary_matrix function.
       - Fixed CFRAC bug in linalg phase after a context update.
       - Changes behavior of SQUFOF: no more user parameters. Now performs
         a multiplier race if and only if it failed without using a multiplier.

 - Late May 2007:
       - More optimizations on SIQS. Need more testing though...
       - Fixed bug in SQUFOF: Was limited to factorization of single precision
         integers. Can now factor up to (roughly) double precision integers.
         Now uses optional multiplier race.

 - Late April 2007->Mid May 2007:
       - Cleaned QS and SIQS + some optimizations.
       - Custom Doxygen style sheet for documentation.

 - March->Mid-April 2007:
       - Completely refactored the factoring algorithms (now use the same
         underlying factoring engine with switches for different behaviours).
       - Also refactored the factoring programs to reduce code duplication.
       - WARNING: Some API changed as a result, plus, some functions/files were
         renamed.
       - Added archive.pl script for maintainers.

 - Feb 9->Feb 23 2007:
       - Added build options to build the library into platform specific
         subdirectories (e.g. ./build/i686/linux/ or ./build/powerpc/darwin/).
       - Some SQUFOF fixes (e.g. added a real square detection test)
       - Added the simple extractres.pl, mergeres.pl and gencomposites.pl
         Perl scripts.
       - Added a binary gcd for unsigned long integers (gcd_ulint).

 - Feb 2->Feb 9 2007:
       - Refactored benchmarker.pl and modified plotmaker.pl. All Perl
         script have now been refactored and are much more extensible. Some
         new Perl modules appeared: Rotor, Bencher, Program and
         ProgramRepository.
       - SQUFOF can now be benchmarked.

 - Jan 29->Feb 2 2007:
       - SimpleConfigReader now understands hashtables in configuration files
       - Refactored and cleaned factorize.pl to ease addition of new algorithms

 - Jan 22->26 2007:
       - Fixed configuration bug wrt BITSTRING_T type
       - Added build option to use GMP internal headers. As a result,
         config.h renamed as tifa_config.h to avoid possible clash. Also
         added MPN-based trial division.
       - Added rough SQUFOF implementation and updated factorize.pl.

 - Fall 2006 & Jan 2007:
       - Performance enhancements of some of Bernstein's algorithms
       - CFRAC: generation of residues now depends on size of numbers
                and uses MPN layer (if needed)
       - Several fixes and other optimizations in the base library
       - prod_tree and similar functions now use MPN layer
       - rem_tree and similar functions now use MPN layer
       - Rewrote Perl scripts: now use distinct Perl modules
       - Moved function first_row_with_one_on_col(...) from gaussian_elim.c to
         matrix.c and added prototype in matrix.h
       - Collected all useful macros in header macros.h
       - Added QS and SIQS algorithm. Implementations are still untuned.
