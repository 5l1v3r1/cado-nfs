 TIFA v0.2.0:
 ------------

 - June 2007:
       - Misc fixes.
       - Added clone_binary_matrix function.
       - Fixed CFRAC bug in linalg phase after a context update.
       - Changes behavior of SQUFOF: no more user parameters. Now performs
         a multiplier race if and only if it failed without using a multiplier.

 - Late May 2007:
       - More optimizations on SIQS. Need more testing though...
       - Fixed bug in SQUFOF: Was limited to factorization of single precision
         integers. Can now factor up to (roughly) double precision integers.
         Now uses optional multiplier race.

 - Late April 2007->Mid May 2007:
       - Cleaned QS and SIQS + some optimizations.
       - Custom Doxygen style sheet for documentation.

 - March->Mid-April 2007:
       - Completely refactored the factoring algorithms (now use the same
         underlying factoring engine with switches for different behaviours).
       - Also refactored the factoring programs to reduce code duplication.
       - WARNING: Some API changed as a result, plus, some functions/files were
         renamed.
       - Added archive.pl script for maintainers.

 - Feb 9->Feb 23 2007:
       - Added build options to build the library into platform specific
         subdirectories (e.g. ./build/i686/linux/ or ./build/powerpc/darwin/).
       - Some SQUFOF fixes (e.g. added a real square detection test)
       - Added the simple extractres.pl, mergeres.pl and gencomposites.pl
         Perl scripts.
       - Added a binary gcd for unsigned long integers (gcd_ulint).

 - Feb 2->Feb 9 2007:
       - Refactored benchmarker.pl and modified plotmaker.pl. All Perl
         script have now been refactored and are much more extensible. Some
         new Perl modules appeared: Rotor, Bencher, Program and
         ProgramRepository.
       - SQUFOF can now be benchmarked.

 - Jan 29->Feb 2 2007:
       - SimpleConfigReader now understands hashtables in configuration files
       - Refactored and cleaned factorize.pl to ease addition of new algorithms

 - Jan 22->26 2007:
       - Fixed configuration bug wrt BITSTRING_T type
       - Added build option to use GMP internal headers. As a result,
         config.h renamed as tifa_config.h to avoid possible clash. Also
         added MPN-based trial division.
       - Added rough SQUFOF implementation and updated factorize.pl.

 - Fall 2006 & Jan 2007:
       - Performance enhancements of some of Bernstein's algorithms
       - CFRAC: generation of residues now depends on size of numbers
                and uses MPN layer (if needed)
       - Several fixes and other optimizations in the base library
       - prod_tree and similar functions now use MPN layer
       - rem_tree and similar functions now use MPN layer
       - Rewrote Perl scripts: now use distinct Perl modules
       - Moved function first_row_with_one_on_col(...) from gaussian_elim.c to
         matrix.c and added prototype in matrix.h
       - Collected all useful macros in header macros.h
       - Added QS and SIQS algorithm. Implementations are still untuned.
