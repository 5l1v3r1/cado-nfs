#!/bin/bash

# This script can be used to run an mpi program with one xterm per job,
# and wraps the program as a child of some ``controlling application''.
# The controlling application is specified as the --tool option, and may
# be gdb (default), or valgrind (or anything you want, provided you
# modify the script accordingly).

# For a standard job, one would change ./a.out <params> to gdb --args ./a.out
# <params>, or valgrind ./a.out <params>.
#
# Here the pattern goes as the typical command:
#       mpirun -np NN <mpi args> ./a.out <args>
# being changed into
#       mpirun -np NN <mpi args> ./tool.sh --tool gdb ./a.out <args>
# or
#       mpirun -np NN <mpi args> ./tool.sh --tool valgrind ./a.out <args>

# Note that per se, this script does not deal with mpi, so it's a generic
# way of running a program controlled by gdb/valgrind within a separate
# xterm...
