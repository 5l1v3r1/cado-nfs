 * The main guy here is the parallelizing_info data type. It is commonly
 * declared as pi.
 *
 * Threads and jobs are arranged in a grid-like manner. Several logical
 * communication group are defined. One for the global grid, as well as
 * one for each column / row.
 *
 * pi->m denotes the global group. There is only one such group. All
 * jobs, all threads contribute to it. At the mpi level, the communicator
 * which is relevant is of course MPI_COMM_WORLD.
 *
 * pi->wr[0] denotes horizontal, a.k.a. ROW groups.
 * pi->wr[1] denotes vertical, a.k.a. COLUMN groups.
 *
 * When a matrix is mapped to a grid process of this kind, say a matrix
 * having been split in nhs * nvs slices, then there are exactly nhs ROW
 * groups, and nvs COLUMN groups. ROW groups consist of nvs (job,thread)
 * items (as many as one finds COL groups), and conversely.

 *
 * At the moment, with openmpi 1.2.8 compiled with
 * --enable-mpi-threads, it does not work (crash observed at
 * MPI_Init_thread -- fairly weird).
 *
 * Mpich2 1.1a2 works, apparently. And it even seems to end up being
 * noticeably faster for my toy examples (= latency-wise).
 *
 * As for the ``fake mpi'' implementation we have, well, it's up to the
 * reader to decide. All collectives are nops, so it's trivially capable.
 * OTOH, not setting the flags ensures that the rest of the code compiles
 * ok.
