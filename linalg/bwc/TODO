This lists some acknowledged bugs that ought to be fixed.

 * lingen is slow. Deserves a complete rewrite.

 * Tuning for the assembly routines for the matrix multiplication has
   never been done. Doing this properly should get a speed-up. Likewise,
   the assembly code can certainly be improved. Perhaps auto-detect cache
   sizes ?


Also some done items.

 [done] code in matops.c and abase-binary-dotprod-backends.h is sometimes
        duplicated. This should be factored.
        [abase-binary-dotprod-backends.h is dead now, and the
        corresponding code has been factored in a layer inside mpfq which
        automatically generates the required code]

 [done] prep.c supports some sort of seeding. Unfortunately, this is
        ineffective in multithreaded context.
        [we resort to saving a binary blob, which is uniquely determined
        by the seed, and later on re-read it as a vector]
