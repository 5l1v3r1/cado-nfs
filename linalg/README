Two binaries in this subdir:
  procrels
  linalg

Makefile should do the compilation (nothing problematic, here).

Assume that the output of checknorms is in a file called rels.
Then you can type:
$ ./procrels rels > mat

On stderr, there is some diagnostic messages. In particular you'll get
the number of relations after singleton removal and the number of primes
on each side. If you want to be sure to have a non-trivial kernel, you
should check that there are more relations than the sum of the two number
of primes.

On stdin (redirected to file mat in the example), procrels will create
data describing the matrix. This include the labels (a,b) for each row.

Now you can type:
$ ./linalg mat > ker

This will compute the kernel of the matrix and print it to ker. For the
moment the output format is not fixed.
