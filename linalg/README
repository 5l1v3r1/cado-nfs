2007-05-22: PG: I have included some implementation of Kernel computation
using Gaussian elimination. This code is not so bad, but is NOT
reentrant, since some global variables are used (beurk...)

2007-05-23: PG: procrels.c 
This is a basic filtering tool. For the moment it only removes
singletons. Problems for the future:
  1) for the moment it makes two passes on the file, stores a lot in
  memory, and so on, so this does not scale to huge computations.
  2) there are still bad complexities parts here and there (possibly
  quadratic)
