How to on the (Main)Lanczos function (still very messy and in an urgent need of clean up but usable).

Input: A standard CACAO sparse matrix file 

Output: A Block (size 64) of independent vectors in the kernel of the sparse matrix. These vectors can be written on a file in standard CACAO format.


NOTE: In the end of the process it is checked that there where no errors during the process and the obtained vectors are in fact in the kernel (if an error is produced please report).

VERY IMPORTANT: It is now working on multi machine multiprocessor mode. If you don't have MPI installed (or simply don't want to use it) just  make FAKE=1 to compile. 


To use it as it is:


Compile it.

To use one job in one machine:  MainLanczos "Sparse matrix file" (optional an output file)

To use multiple jobs in one machine:  orterun -np  "number of jobs"  MainLanczos  "Sparse matrix file" (optional an output file)

NOTE: For the next one, be sure that the sparse matrix file is accessible to every machine/job.
NOTE1: For nodes having k connections (ethernet addresses) use each one as a different machine to improve communication between the jobs.

To use multiple jobs in multiple machines: orterun -np "number of jobs" --host  "Machine1","Machine2",etc MainLanczos  "Sparse matrix file" (optional an output file)



To use with bl.pl:

./bl.pl [options]
options: (* : mandatory)
* matrix=<matrix_file>
* solution=<solution_file_to_write_to>
wdir=<working_directory>
tidy=[01] ; 0 means: do not purge working directory upon exit.
machines='machine1 machine2 machine3'
    runs in mpi mode. One job per machine. Put the machine several times
    if several jobs per machine are desired.
