INPUT:

* a matrix file, which is actually unread except for its header line which
must have the following format:

// 1000 ROWS 1000 COLUMNS ; MODULUS 285451712094810683706092566195203997697

(the matrix must be square)

* The real input consists of files A-00-00, A-00-01, ... where A-II-JJ is
the sequence ( Transpose(X_II) * M^i * Y_JJ), for increasing indices
starting from _zero_. Together these files form the m*n matrix polynomial
A(X)\in K[X]^(m*n).

OUTPUT:

* output is placed in files F00 F01 ..., where  each file represents a
vector polynomial F(X)\in K[X]^(n*1), satisfying:

A(X) F(X) = G(X) + O(X^t)

only some correspond to generating polynomials (where t-\deg G shows some
gap). These are the ones mentioned in the ``LOOK'' statement as output by
the program upon exit:

// step 1013 LOOK [ 2 3 ]

which suggests looking at F02 and F03, as we can expect them to be
generators (a rule of thumb is that generally, the generators are in the
smallest files, because their nominal degree stopped increasing).

one F file represent some vector polynomial, hence n polynomials
\sum_i f_{0,i}X^i
\sum_i f_{1,i}X^i
...
\sum_i f_{n-1,i}X^i

the F files are written as follows:
f_{0,0} f{1,0} ... f_{n-1,0}
f_{0,1} f{1,1} ... f_{n-1,1}
f_{0,2} f{1,2} ... f_{n-1,2}
...

(in the case m=n=1, F is the reversal of the minimal polynomial)
