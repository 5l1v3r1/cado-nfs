Here's a short list that acknowledges the pending to-do list


- accept the cado format	(trivial)
- modify the mksol code for handling several solutions simultaneously (easy)
- finish porting the lingen code -- it's quadratic and slow so far.
- test the bit-reverse madness.
- fix the mt code -- it seems to break (no idea)
- add mpi (tedious)
- add an rhs= option to doit.pl (there's already a precond option). (easy)
