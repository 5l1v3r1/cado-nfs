* improve the use of free relations: currently we generate free relations
  up to the algebraic factor base bound (alim). We can do much better:

  (a) after the purge phase (removal of singletons), find all remaining
      primes on the algebraic side
  (b) determine those primes for which the algebraic polynomial completely
      splits into linear factors
  (c) add free relations for those primes

  In particular when using the lattice siever, all special-q's for which f(x)
  completely splits should appear in (b).
