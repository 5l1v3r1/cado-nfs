# Usage: nightly-test <MAKE_ARGS>
# If you use this in your crontab, since cron does not have access to
# ssh-agent, a trick is the following:
# 1) run from your home directory: ssh-keygen -N "" -t rsa -f .ssh/cle_gforge
#    This will create a ssh key with empty passphrase in .ssh/cle_gforge,
#    with the public key in .ssh/cle_gforge.pub
# 2) add the content of .ssh/cle_gforge.pub in the list of your ssh keys on
#    gforge.inria.fr (this will be added in authorized_keys)
# 3) add the following lines in your .ssh/config file:
# Host scm.gforge.inria.fr
#    IdentityFile /users/mygroup/mylogin/.ssh/cle_gforge
# 4) since run.c59 also calls ssh, you need to add also IdentityFile ... for
#    the computer on which you run nightly-test, and to add the content of
#    cle_gforge.pub in the authorized_keys on that computer.
