These parameters are experimental and are used as input for merge_linagl_sqrt:

	mergelevel	cwmax	rwmax
c72	20		30	100
c85a	20		40	50
c90	20		40	100
c95	20		40	80
rsa100	20		40	150/200	

For new parameters, some fiddling is needed, with respect to the final
weight of the small matrix and/or the number of rows/columns depending on
the linear algebra algorithm used.
