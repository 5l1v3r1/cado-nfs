Installation guide for the gf2x package.
========================================

Authors: Richard Brent, Pierrick Gaudry, Emmanuel Thomé, Paul Zimmermann.

This package contains routines for fast arithmetic in GF(2)[x]
(multiplication, squaring, gcd).

It contains the following files:


Misc:

README       - this file
COPYING      - GNU General Public License

Actual code:

gf2x.h            - main header file
thresholds.h      - tuning results. The file contains some defaults.
mul-gf2x.c        - main entry code
gen_bb_mul_code.c - generates low-level multiplication routines
mul2t.c           - implements 128x128 -> 256 bit product with SSE2 instructions
mul-small.c       - code for small sizes
mul-basecase.c    - base case code
mul-toom.c        - main file for Karatsuba and Toom-Cook multiplication
mulfft-bit.c      - multiplication over GF(2)[x] using Fast Fourier Transform

For tuning:

tuneup.c   - tuning program for schoolbook/Karatsuba/Toom-Cook multiplication
tunefft.c  - program to tune the FFT multiplication
tunetoom.c - program to tune Toom-Cook multiplication
best_k.sh  - helper script for tuning
replace.c  - Helper code
replace.h  - Helper code
timing.c   - Helper code
timing.h   - Helper code

For testing:

factor.c     - finds smallest irreducible factor of trinomial over GF(2)
HalfGCD.c    - subquadratic gcd over GF(2)[x]
test.c       - trivial test.
checkXXX.*   - test sets

No longer used:

patch-wrt-ntl-5.3.1 - patch for file GF2X.c from NTL

Instructions to install the package:
===================================

1) Type:

      make

   If your machine word size is not automatically detected, you might
   have to type:
   
      make w=64

   At this point, you should have a working libgf2x.a ; However it is not
   tuned. It means in particular that the FFT is not available.

2) tune Karatsuba/Toom-Cook and FFT multiplication

      make tune-all

   This unfortunately takes a long while.

3) run:

      make check

   to see whether everything went ok.
