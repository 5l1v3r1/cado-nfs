Required software tools:
=======================

*) SCONS (http://www.scons.org/)
*) GMP (http://gmplib.org): usually installed in most Linux distributions

[Configure]
=====================)

cp Makefile.local.example Makefile.local
Edit according to your local settings and your taste

You can have specific Makefile.local in each subdir, if you want.
Otherwise a link to your main Makefile.local is automatically created
during compilation.

Compile:
=======

make clean ; make

(really do make clean if you happen to touch .h files, as there are no
auto-dependencies)

Run an example:
===============

tmp=/tmp
name=c59

# or for csh addicts:
setenv tmp /tmp; setenv name c59

cat <<EOF > $tmp/$name
n:71641520761751435455133616475667090434063332228247871795429

## SIEVING_STEP
## the sieving parameters must be given by hand, sorry!

## below might be too small with different polynomials)

## and check the sieving parameters are optimal

own risk, see sieve/README.las]

Using merge_linalg_sqrt2.sh
----------------------------

Since we are having zillions of parameters (and more to come), 
this script takes as input a configuration file for the filtering phase.
At the same time, it is designed to handle zillions of relation files if
needed.

	./merge_linalg_sqrt2.sh name.params rel1 rel2 ... relk

will read files relation files rel1 to relk to form the name.nodup first big
(as yet) intermediate file. When just 'name.params' is given, the script looks
for files beginning rels.* and uses them.

A param file consists of lines, as in:

root: Examples/c59b/c59b
prune: 1.0
maxlevel: 5
cwmax: 10
rwmax: 40
mt: 4
bwstrat: 1

mt means multithreading to 4, bwstrat to 1 means use merge and stop when
cN is "minimal".

Parameters that are not found in the file received default
values. For instance, you can override the choice of the 'name' parameter
which defauts to $root.$prune"x"$maxlevel"x"$cwmax"x"$rwmax and can be
boring for some users. Just put:

name: toto_likes_his_tata

as directory files for intermediate computations if you like.

The param file can contain more parameters that can be deduced from the
parsing phase of the script. For instance, desperate purge computations
might use 'maxpr' and 'maxpa', or you can use a different bw-merge strategy.

(for CACAO members) How to use the files in /net/tiramisu/cado1/cado/Examples:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example with /net/tiramisu/cado1/cado/c80 (for sh addicts):

tmp=/localdisk/tmp; name=c80; d=/net/tiramisu/cado1/cado/Examples
# or for csh addicts:
set tmp=/localdisk/tmp; set name=c80; set d=/net/tiramisu/cado1/cado/Examples

/bin/rm -fr $tmp/$name.*
cp $d/$name/$name.poly $tmp
# generate free relations (optional)
sieve/makefb -poly $tmp/$name.poly > $tmp/$name.roots
./linalg/freerel -poly $tmp/$name.poly -fb $tmp/$name.roots > $tmp/$name.rels
# normally the norms are already completely factored, but just in case...
postsieve/checknorms/checknorms -poly $tmp/$name.poly $d/$name/$name.rels \
   >> $tmp/$name.rels
./merge_linalg_sqrt.sh $tmp/$name <parameters> [see README.params]
/bin/rm -fr $tmp/$name.*
