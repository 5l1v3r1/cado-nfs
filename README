Required software tools:
========================

*) GMP (http://gmplib.org): usually installed in most Linux distributions
*) The GCC compiler works ; some others might, but it is untested.
*) GNU make and CMake for building (CMake is installed on the fly if missing)

[Configure]
===========

if your site needs tweaks:

cp local.sh.example local.sh
Edit according to your local settings and your taste. You may have things
such as:

GMP=$HOME/gmp-4.2.4-install-tree/
CFLAGS=-msse2 -O2
CC=/usr/local/gcc-4.3.2/bin/gcc

Note that such tweaks are global ; although earlier CADO versions offered
the possibility of setting tweaks at a sub-directory level, this is no
longer so easily doable (but one could try to restore this functionality,
though).

You may notice that local.sh.example has lines such as
: ${CFLAGS:="-O2 -DNDEBUG"}

This means ``set CFLAGS to "-O2 -DNDEBUG" if it isn't set to something
else already. In particular, in such a case, having an environment
variable CFLAGS can be a handy to override everything even the local.sh
settings.


Compile:
========

make

It may or may not be relevant to do ``make install'' as well ; at the
moment consider ``make install'' to be badly tested.


Run an example:
===============

./run_example.sh c59

The script tries to factor a 59 digit number.

For other numbers, create a parameter file analogous to params/params.c59
and call ./run_example.sh the same way.
