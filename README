Required software tools:
=======================

*) GMP (http://gmplib.org): usually installed in most Linux distributions
*) The GCC compiler works ; some others might, but it is untested.
*) GNU make for building

[Configure]
=====================)

if your site needs tweaks:

cp Makefile.local.example Makefile.local
Edit according to your local settings and your taste. You may have things
such as:

GMP=$HOME/gmp-4.2.4-install-tree/
CFLAGS=-msse2 -O2
CC=/usr/local/gcc-4.3.2/bin/gcc

In each sub-directory (*), the top-level Makefile.local is read if it
exists. Then the Makefile.local present in the directory is read if it
exists (thereby overriding settings from the top-level file).


Compile:
=======

make clean ; make

(really do make clean if you happen to touch .h files, as there are no
auto-dependencies)

Run an example:
===============

./new_run.c59

The script tries to factor a 59 digit number.

For other numbers, create a parameter file analogous to params.c59
and call new_cadofactor.pl with this file name and further parameters
as can be seen in new_run.c59.
