See ../../test/inputs/README for the input format used for polyselect.

The output format is that of ggnfs (any line starting with # is a comment,
sss is a string, nnn a non-negative integer, zzz a signed integer, ddd a
floating-point number):

name: sss # optional
n: nnn    # number to factor
skew: ddd # skewness
c5: zzz   # coefficient of degree 5 (algebraic side)
...
c0: zzz   # coefficient of degree 0 (algebraic side)
Y1: zzz   # coefficient of degree 1 (rational side)
Y0: zzz   # coefficient of degree 0 (rational side)
type: gnfs
rlim: nnn # rational factor base bound
alim: nnn # algebraic factor base bound
lpbr: nnn # rational large prime bound is 2^nnn
lpba: nnn # algebraic large prime bound is 2^nnn
mfbr: nnn # only residuals below 2^nnn are factored on the rational side
mfba: nnn # only residuals below 2^nnn are factored on the algebraic side
rlambda: ddd # lambda sieve parameter on the rational side
alambda: ddd # lambda sieve parameter on the algebraic side
qintsize: nnn # after nnn special q (lattice sieve), stop and count relations
q0:   nnn # special-q must be >= q0
