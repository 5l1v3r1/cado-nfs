Rationale:
----------

The current file format is the following:
p: r1,r2,r3
...

This is fine for typical primes, but does not carry enough information
for powers or multiple roots.


New format:
-----------

An entry is of the form:

q:n: r1,r2,r3

In the (frequent) case where n=1, this can be abridged with:

q: r1,r2,r3

Here, q is a prime or a prime power, ri are the corresponding roots and n
is the number of times log p must be subtracted at these positions
(assuming smaller powers of this prime have alredy be taken care of).
By position, we mean (a,b) such that a - b*ri = 0 mod q.

The roots ri must be sorted.  If a root ri is greater or equal to q, it
means that this is a projective root: subtracting q gives a root for the
reciprocal polynomial (or equivalently, (1:(ri-q)) is the projective
root).

It is allowed to have several lines with the same q, but there must be
only one line for a given (q,n) pair. 

Lines starting with a # are comments.
