# Machine description file.
#
# This file is split into several sections [cluster_name].
# The sections are independent.
#
# Each section is read in order.
# Leading white space is not significant.
# Lines starting with ``something='' affect the variable ``something''.
# Lines starting with a word without ``='' denote a machine name.
# A machine name may be followed by variable assignments which are specific to
# the machine.
#
# Some info on accepted variables:
# tmpdir and cadodir are mandatory.
# cores defaults to 1.
# group is planned for use in linear algebra.
# 
#
# Changing the list during a computation:
# #######################################
#
# If during a computation you want to add a machine, you just have to add
# appropriate line. Next time cadofactor.pl will check if there are finished
# jobs, it will also start new ones on the new machine. You can also increase
# the number of cores of an already listed machine. 
#
# If you need to stop the jobs on a machine, you can put cores=0 after its
# name. Once the current job is finished on the machine, no new job will be
# started again. Do not remove the machine name of the list, otherwise
# cadofactor.pl won't know where to look for tmp data to import result.
# If you can not wait for the job to be finished, feel free to kill it after
# having put cores=0 in this file: cadofactor.pl will eventually detect that
# the job is dead and import the partial result file.
#
# When you decrease the value of cores, this will have a similar effect: the
# script will let the job finish but won't start new ones until the number of 
# jobs becomes less than the value of cores.
#
# If you need to change the tmpdir during a computation, this is more tricky, 
# since cadofactor.pl assumes that all the jobs on a machine run with the same
# tmpdir. Therefore, you have do it like so:
#  - put cores=0 for the target machine
#  - wait until all running jobs of the machine are finished
#  - change tmpdir for this machine
#  - put the previous value of cores.
