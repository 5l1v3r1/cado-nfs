OPAL is a Python package for automatic parameter optimization based on the
separate, binary NOMAD library.

Download NOMAD.zip from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nomad-bb-opt/>
For entertainment purposes, this .zip file is actually a bzip2-compressed
tar archive. Build it with:
  cd nomad.3.6.2 && cd install && ./install.sh
  Copy ../bin/nomad to some directory in PATH. (Sadly, OPAL insists on
  executing NOMAD simply as os.system('nomad ' + ...); it does not allow
  specifying a path)

Download OPAL from <https://github.com/dpo/opal>, or clone with
  git clone https://github.com/dpo/opal.git
Install OPAL into your user site directory:
  cd opal && python setup.py install --user

Copy the polynomial file from a c59 factorization to
  scripts/opal-test/c59.polyselect2.poly
Edit las_run.py so that build_dir variable points to your CADO build
directory. A (very slow) automatic optimization of the 
{a,r}{lambda,lim,pba} and I parameters can then be started with
  python las_optimize.py
