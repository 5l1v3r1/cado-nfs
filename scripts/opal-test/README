OPAL is a Python package for automatic parameter optimization based on the
separate, binary NOMAD library.

Download NOMAD.zip from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nomad-bb-opt/>
For entertainment purposes, this .zip file is actually a bzip2-compressed
tar archive. Build it with:
  cd nomad.3.6.2 && cd install && ./install.sh
  Copy ../bin/nomad to some directory in PATH. (Sadly, OPAL insists on
  executing NOMAD simply as os.system('nomad ' + ...); it does not allow
  specifying a path)

Download OPAL from <https://github.com/dpo/opal>, or clone with
  git clone https://github.com/dpo/opal.git
Install OPAL into your user site directory:
  cd opal && python setup.py install --user

[the following documentation is out-of-date: start of new documentation]

- copy a polynomial file to the current directory, say c60.poly
- copy a parameter file to the current directory, say params.c60
- run ./optimize.sh params.c60 c60.poly
- at the end of the optimization, the optimized parameter file will be
  params.c60.opt in the current directory. If some optimized variables
  are at the border of an initial interval (for example if optimize.sh
  tried 10 <= I <= 12, and the optimized file uses I=10), you might want
  to rerun the optimization with the new optimized file:
  $ mv params.c60.opt params.c60
  $ ./optimize.sh params.c60 c60.poly

(more details at the beginning of the file optimize.sh)

Copy the polynomial file from a c59 factorization to
  scripts/opal-test/c59.polyselect2.poly
Edit las_run.py so that build_dir variable points to your CADO build
directory. A (very slow) automatic optimization of the 
{a,r}{lambda,lim,pba} and I parameters can then be started with
  python las_optimize.py

The optimal parameters are written in a file nomad-solution.xxx.txt,
in the order they are defined in las_declaration.py, for example:

0.900000000000000 # alambda
1.100000500679016 # rlambda
1000000           # alim
1000000           # rlim
19                # lpba
19                # lpbr
23                # mfba
21                # mfbr
11                # I

For larger numbers, you should also update the hard-coded parameters in
las_declaration.py, especially if one of the optimized parameters equals
one of its bounds defined in that file.

Optimizing parameters for a SNFS computation
============================================

The current optimization code assumes we use special-q's on the algebraic side.
With special-q's on the rational side, some changes have to be made:

1) report.py, line 15: change 'algebraic' into 'rational'

2) las_run.py, line 77: change q0 = las_params["alim"] into
                               q0 = las_params["rlim"]

3) some other changes might be needed...
