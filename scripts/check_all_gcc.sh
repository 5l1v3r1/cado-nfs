# This script downloads, builds, and runs cado-nfs on several machines.
# The machines from the gcc compile farm are taken as an example. Tests
# are done in parallel on the different nodes. Once all jobs are
# finished, a digest is sent by mail, with a tar.gz attachment containing
# all the results. The output can probably be improved (e.g. give
# warnings in a text attachments, not buried inside a tar.gz).  The
# requirement is that cmake is present on the target machines (as per the
# companion script, here gcc-script.sh).

# The companion script gcc-script.sh is of course required.

# In order to access the machines through ssh, it is mandatory to have
# proper support in  ~/.ssh/config. For the gcc compile farm, e.g.:
# GET http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/CompileFarm | perl ~thome/.ssh/parse-cfarm.pl

# results with cado-nfs-1.1-RC5.tar.gz
