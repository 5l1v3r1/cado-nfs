# Parameters form a tree structure. 
# A parameter of the form
# foo.bar.baz = 42
# is said to have path "foo.bar", key "baz", and value "42".

# All quotes in the comments in this file are for emphasis and not part of
# the parameters.

# Objects of the Python scripts that take parameters from the parameter file 
# have a path associated with them; for example, the Sieving task uses path
# "tasks.sieving", and the las siever run in the Sieving task uses
# "tasks.sieving.las". When looking for a parameter, we start at the object's 
# path, then work towards to root of the tree until the key is found.

# Some variable substitution occurs in the values specified in a parameter file:
# A string of the form "${FOO}" is substituted by the value of the shell
# environment variable "$FOO".
# A string of the form "$(foo)" is substituted by the value of the parameter
# with key "foo", where the search starts at the path where "$(foo)" occurred.


# name: The name of the factorization project. Will be used as part of file

# workdir: the path of the working directory; if a relative path is
# specified, it is relative to the CWD from which cadofactor is run.
# All the output files of sieving, filtering, etc., are stored under the
# working directory.
# In principle it is possible to specify a different working directory for
# each task, which may be beneficial to use disk space across several file
# systems, or to let filtering tasks read from one hard drive while writing
# to another, improving throughput.

# execpath: Specify the search path for binary programs that should be run.
# Each binary program that is run can be specified with "execpath",
# "execsubdir", and "execbin" parameters; the script looks for the binary
# executable as "execpath/execsubdir/execbin" and "execpath/execbin", in this
# order. Defaults for these parameters are defined for each program in
# cadoprograms.py.
# The Program instances use parameter path, e.g., "tasks.sieving.las", or
# "tasks.filter.merge.merge", but of course can find their parameter from 
# further up the parameter tree, such as in "tasks".

# Clients which cadofactor should start are specified under "slaves".

# the same download directory; files are protected by locking to prevent

# this filesystem must support locking.

# the working directory includes the clientid which should ensure uniqueness.
