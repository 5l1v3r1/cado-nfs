Temporary HOWTO: how to compile binaries for the filtering step for FFS ?

1. purge-ffs-f2 without gf2x

In cado-nfs directory, type:

  cd ffs
  make
  cd ..
  make dup1 dup2 purge-ffs-f2 purge-ffs-f3 merge-ffs replay-ffs


2. purge-ffs-f2 with gf2x from CADO-NFS:

In ffs/Makefile, uncomment the following line:
  
  # GF2XPREFIX = ../build/`hostname`/gf2x

In filter/CMakeLists-nodist.txt, uncomment the following lines:
  
  #link_directories (${CADO_NFS_BINARY_DIR}/gf2x/.libs)
  ...
  #target_link_libraries(purge-ffs-f2 utils pthread libfppol-f2.a gf2x)
  ...
  #add_dependencies(purge-ffs-f2 gf2x-build)

and comment the following line:
  
  target_link_libraries(purge-ffs-f2 utils pthread libfppol-f2.a)

Then, in cado-nfs directory, type:
  
  make gf2x-build
  cd ffs
  make
  cd ..
  make dup1 dup2 purge-ffs-f2 purge-ffs-f3 merge-ffs replay-ffs
