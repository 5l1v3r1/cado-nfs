README on how to compile and run the filtering step for FFS.

1. Compilation:
===============

To compile purge-ffs-f2 without gf2x, go directly to Step 1 

Step 0: 
  In ffs/Makefile, uncomment the line beginning by:
  
    # GF2XPREFIX = ...

  In filter/CMakeLists-nodist.txt, uncomment the following lines:
  
    #link_directories (${CADO_NFS_BINARY_DIR}/gf2x/.libs)
    ...
    #target_link_libraries(purge-ffs-f2 utils pthread libfppol-f2.a gf2x)
    ...
    #add_dependencies(purge-ffs-f2 gf2x-build)

  and comment the following line:
  
    target_link_libraries(purge-ffs-f2 utils pthread libfppol-f2.a)

Then, in cado-nfs directory, type:
  
  make gf2x-build


Step 1: in cado-nfs directory, type:

  cd ffs
  make
  cd ..
  make dup1 dup2 purge-ffs-f2 purge-ffs-f3 merge-ffs replay-ffs


2. Run:
=======

To run the filtering step for FFS, see the top filter.sh script in this
directory.
