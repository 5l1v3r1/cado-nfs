Recipe to run an example (as of end of April 27, 2012).
----------------------------------------------------

- compile:
  
  make 

- construct a parameter file:

  Examples are given in param.2.607 , param.3.426 .

- create the factor bases:

  cd makefb; ./makefb.sage ../param.2.127; cd ..
  
  This will take some time... (see below for using the faster magma version).
  In the end, the files are written in the makefb/ subdir, so you should
  move them back:

  mv makefb/*roots* .
  
- rename the factor base files to specific names, so that they are not
  overriden by the next call to makefb.mag:

  The default names given in the param file are:
  mv Aroots Aroots.2.127
  mv Rroots Rroots.2.127
  (adapt for charac 3)

- run:

  build/f2/sieve param.2.127
  or 
  build/f3/sieve param.3.97

  This should output relations for the special-q range specified in the param
  files.
  Parameters can be changed on the command-line, for instance:

  build/f2/sieve param.2.127 -I 12 -lpb1 24 -q1 200000

- debug! ;-)



---------------------------------------------------------

Old way of building the factor base:

  At the moment, the polynomials are hardcoded and correspond to those in
  param.2.127 and param.3.97.
  
  Tune the factor base bounds by editing makefb.mag and then create the
  files:
  echo "p:=2; load \"makefb.mag\";" | magma -b
  or
  echo "p:=3; load \"makefb.mag\";" | magma -b

  This will create two files Aroots and Rroots.
  NB: these file names are absolute names.
