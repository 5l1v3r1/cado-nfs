Recipe to run an example (as of end of Mar 7, 2012).
----------------------------------------------------

- compile:
  
  make 

- create the factor base:

  At the moment, the polynomials are hardcoded and correspond to those in
  param.2.127 and param.3.97.
  
  Tune the factor base bounds by editing makefb.mag and then create the
  files:
  echo "p:=2; load \"makefb.mag\";" | magma -b
  or
  echo "p:=3; load \"makefb.mag\";" | magma -b

  This will create two files Aroots and Rroots.
  NB: these file names are absolute names. 

- rename the factor base files to specific names, so that they are not
  overriden by the next call to makefb.mag:

  The default names given in the param file are:
  mv Aroots Aroots.2.127
  mv Rroots Rroots.2.127
  (adapt for charac 3)

- run:

  build/f2/sieve param.2.127
  or 
  build/f3/sieve param.3.97

  This should output relations for the special q specified in the param
  files.
  Parameters (including q,rho) can be changed on the command-line, for
  instance:

  build/f2/sieve param.2.127 -I 12 -lpb0 24 

- debug! ;-)
