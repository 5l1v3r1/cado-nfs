Recipe to run an example (as of end of Feb 2012).
-------------------------------------------------

/!\ Only for characteristic 2.

- compile:
  
  make sieve.f2

- prepare:
  Some polynomials are hardcoded in sieve.c. They correspond to a
  GF(2^127) example.
  The same polynomials and some bounds are hardcoded as well in a magma
  script to create he factor base files. Just run:

  magma < makefb.mag

  This will create two files Aroots and Rroots.

- run:

  ./sieve.f2 <q> <rho>

  For example:

  ./sieve.f2 3468B8B 810E4A

  This should output relations for this special q.

- debug! ;-)
