This is some code to perform the sieving step in the Function Field Sieve
algorithm. It concentrates on the characteristic 2 and 3 for the moment.

Some code (not much) is stolen from CADO-NFS (in that case it is visible
in the header of the file).

Currently no licence -> you are not allowed to redistribute.
We expect this code to become LGPL.
