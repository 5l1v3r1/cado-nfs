Important changes between cado-nfs-1.0 and cado-nfs-1.1:

* the polynomial selection uses the new algorithm presented by Kleinjung at
  the 2008 CADO workshop (supports multithreading)
* connecting rootsieve5 in the polynomial selection
* las supports I=16 (useful for the integer greater than 200 digits), minor bug
  fix, small speedup in las and purge.
* reorganization executable in the linear algebra step and acceleration
  of computing time on many machines with mpi
* adding scripts to execute the sieve on a cluster with OAR in the "besteffort"
  mode (also exists scripts for linear algebra in developpement version)
* adding of new parameter files and few new variables inside (cf params.c91)
